## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- **Xcode 16+** (for Swift 6 support)
- **iOS 18+** deployment target
- **Apple Developer Account** (for testing biometrics)

### Running the App
```bash
# Open the project
open VoiceIt.xcodeproj

# Or from command line
cd /Users/leone/IOS_Apps/VoiceIt
xcodebuild -project VoiceIt.xcodeproj -scheme VoiceIt -sdk iphonesimulator build
```

Press **⌘R** in Xcode to build and run!

## 🏗️ Architecture (2025 Best Practices)

### Technology Stack
- **Swift 6** with Strict Concurrency
- **SwiftUI** for declarative UI
- **SwiftData** for local persistence (iOS 18+)
- **@Observable** macro for modern state management
- **CryptoKit** for end-to-end encryption

### Architecture Patterns
- **Service Layer Pattern**: Separation of business logic from UI
- **Protocol-Based Models**: No inheritance for iOS 18 SwiftData compatibility
- **Direct Model Usage**: Models used directly in views where appropriate
- **View Models**: Only for complex UI coordination
- **Dependency Injection**: Services injected through environment

## 🛠️ Development

### Swift 6 Concurrency Guidelines

**Critical Rules:**
- Services are NOT marked with `@MainActor`
- UI updates wrapped in `await MainActor.run { }`
- NEVER nest `MainActor.run` calls in `@MainActor` contexts
- All services conform to `Sendable` or `@unchecked Sendable`

**Example:**
```swift
// ✅ Correct
class LocationService: @unchecked Sendable {
    func updateLocation() {
        Task { @MainActor in
            self.currentLocation = newLocation
        }
    }
}

// ❌ Wrong - causes deadlocks
@MainActor
class LocationService {
    func updateLocation() async {
        await MainActor.run {  // Deadlock!
            self.currentLocation = newLocation
        }
    }
}
```

### SwiftData Best Practices
- Models use `@Model` macro
- Protocol-based design (no model inheritance for iOS 18)
- Container configured with encryption support
- Queries use `@Query` in views
- All models marked `@available(iOS 18, *)`

### Service Layer Pattern
```swift
// Services handle business logic
class EncryptionService: Sendable {
    func encrypt(_ data: Data) async throws -> Data { }
}

// Views inject services via Environment
struct ContentView: View {
    @Environment(\.encryptionService) var encryption
}
```

## 🧪 Testing

### Unit Tests (To Be Implemented)
- Service layer logic
- Encryption/decryption
- Data model validation
- Export format generation

### Integration Tests (To Be Implemented)
- SwiftData persistence
- Location tracking flow
- Emergency contact workflow
- Export generation end-to-end

## 🌐 Future Backend Requirements

Currently, VoiceIt operates **100% locally** with all data stored on-device. However, several features would benefit from optional backend infrastructure. This section outlines where and why backend services would be needed.

### Community Features Backend

**Current Status**: Mock data for demonstration  
**Backend Required For**: Full community functionality

#### 1. Support Groups Backend

**Location**: `VoiceIt/Services/CommunityService.swift` (lines ~50-150)

**Required Backend Services**:
```
Backend Endpoint Structure:

POST   /api/v1/groups                    # Create support group
GET    /api/v1/groups                    # List all groups
GET    /api/v1/groups/:id                # Get group details
GET    /api/v1/groups/:id/posts          # Get group posts
POST   /api/v1/groups/:id/posts          # Create post (anonymous)
POST   /api/v1/posts/:id/report          # Report inappropriate content
GET    /api/v1/groups/:id/moderators     # Get moderator info
```

**Database Schema Needed**:
```sql

---

### Optional Cloud Sync

**Current Status**: 100% local storage  
**Backend Required For**: Cross-device sync and encrypted cloud backup

**Why Users Might Want This**:
- Backup evidence in case device is lost/destroyed
- Access evidence from multiple devices
- Transfer evidence when upgrading phones

**Privacy-First Cloud Sync Architecture**:

```
Backend Endpoint Structure:

POST   /api/v1/auth/register             # Register anonymous account
POST   /api/v1/auth/login                # Login with device token
POST   /api/v1/sync/upload               # Upload encrypted evidence
GET    /api/v1/sync/download             # Download encrypted evidence
DELETE /api/v1/sync/wipe                 # Remote wipe all data
GET    /api/v1/sync/status               # Get sync status
```

**Database Schema**:
```sql
-- Anonymous User Accounts
CREATE TABLE user_accounts (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    device_token VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE, -- Hashed device ID
    encrypted_master_key TEXT, -- User's master key, encrypted with device password
    storage_used_bytes BIGINT DEFAULT 0,
    last_sync_at TIMESTAMP,
    created_at TIMESTAMP
);

-- Encrypted Evidence Blobs
CREATE TABLE encrypted_evidence (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id UUID REFERENCES user_accounts(id),
    evidence_id UUID, -- Client-side evidence ID
    encrypted_blob BYTEA, -- Fully encrypted evidence
    blob_size_bytes BIGINT,
    evidence_type VARCHAR(50),
    uploaded_at TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP,
    deleted_at TIMESTAMP -- Soft delete
);
```

**Zero-Knowledge Requirements**:
- Client encrypts all data before upload
- Server never has decryption keys
- Server only stores encrypted blobs
- Metadata is also encrypted
- User can remote wipe all data

**Technology Recommendations**:
- **Backend**: Go (for performance), Rust (for security)
- **Storage**: Object storage with encryption at rest
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with full disk encryption
- **Hosting**: Privacy-focused (Switzerland, Iceland data centers)

**Implementation Location**:
- Create new `CloudSyncService.swift` in `VoiceIt/Services/`
- Add settings in `SettingsView.swift` under Privacy section
- Implement E2E encryption in `EncryptionService.swift`

---

### Professional Services Integration

**Backend Required For**: Real therapist/lawyer provider networks

#### Third-Party Integrations Needed

1. **Therapist Network API**:
   - Integration with platforms like BetterHelp API, TalkSpace API
   - Verify therapist credentials via national databases
   - Real-time availability calendars

2. **Legal Network API**:
   - Integration with LegalZoom, Avvo, or state bar associations
   - Verify bar certifications
   - Pro bono matching algorithms

3. **Video Conferencing**:
   - Zoom SDK, Twilio Video, or Jitsi
   - HIPAA-compliant video for therapy sessions
   - Recording controls with consent

4. **Payment Processing** (If moving beyond free tier):
   - Stripe for payments
   - Sliding scale payment options
   - Pro bono voucher system

**Implementation Note**: These would require separate API contracts and likely backend middleware to coordinate between VoiceIt and third-party services.

### Privacy-First Backend Principles

All backend services MUST follow these principles:

1. **Zero-Knowledge Architecture**: Server never decrypts user evidence
2. **No Analytics by Default**: No tracking, no user profiling
3. **Minimal Data Collection**: Only collect what's absolutely necessary
4. **Open Source**: Backend code should be open source for audit
5. **GDPR/CCPA Compliant**: Right to deletion, data portability
6. **Regular Security Audits**: Third-party penetration testing
7. **Transparency Reports**: Publish data on any government requests
8. **Data Residency**: Allow users to choose data location
9. **No Third-Party Trackers**: No Google Analytics, Facebook pixels, etc.
10. **Encryption Everywhere**: TLS 1.3, E2E encryption, encrypted backups

## 🤝 Contributing

This is a privacy-first application. Any contributions must:
- Maintain end-to-end encryption
- Respect user privacy (no analytics, tracking, or cloud storage)
- Follow Swift 6 concurrency patterns
- Include comprehensive tests
- Document security implications

## 📄 License

TBD - Intended for use in sensitive situations. License will prioritize user privacy and safety.

## 📚 Appendix

### Evidence Preview & Change Tracking Implementation

**Last Updated**: October 7, 2025

This section documents the evidence preview and change tracking system that allows users to view detailed evidence previews and maintains a complete audit trail of all modifications.

#### Overview

Users can now:
- **Click any evidence item** in the timeline to view full details
- **Edit text entries** while preserving all previous versions
- **View change history** for all evidence types
- **See full-size photo previews** with metadata
- **Track modifications** with timestamps and descriptions

#### Key Features

1. **Expandable Detail Views**
   - Tap any evidence item to navigate to `EvidenceDetailView`
   - Photos display full-size with decryption on-demand
   - Text entries show complete content with word count
   - Voice notes display transcription and audio information
   - Video evidence shows thumbnails and metadata

2. **Comprehensive Change Tracking**
   - All modifications recorded with timestamps
   - Before/after content comparison
   - Optional change descriptions
   - Visual timeline of changes
   - Immutable history (cannot be deleted)

3. **Text Entry Editing**
   - Full-screen editor with live preview
   - Side-by-side comparison of changes
   - Word count tracking (additions/removals)
   - Optional context descriptions
   - Original content always preserved

4. **Legal Integrity**
   - Complete audit trail for legal documentation
   - Tamper-evident history
   - Timestamped modifications
   - Encrypted along with evidence
   - Automatic cascade delete with evidence

#### Technical Implementation

**New Models:**
- `ChangeHistory.swift` - Tracks all evidence modifications
  - Stores previous and new content
  - Links to parent evidence via relationships
  - Supports all evidence types

**New Views:**
- `EvidenceDetailView.swift` - Main detail view for all evidence types
- `ChangeHistoryView.swift` - Visual timeline component
- `EditTextEntrySheet.swift` - Text editing interface

**Modified Models:**
- All evidence models (`TextEntry`, `PhotoEvidence`, `VoiceNote`, `VideoEvidence`) now include:
  - `changeHistory: [ChangeHistory]` relationship
  - `updateNotes(_:)` method for tracking note changes
  - `updateBodyText(_:description:)` method (TextEntry only)
  - Automatic creation history entry on initialization

**Modified Views:**
- `TimelineView.swift` - Added `NavigationLink` to detail views

#### Change Types Tracked

- **Created**: Initial evidence creation
- **Content Modified**: Text content changed (preserves original)
- **Note Added**: First note added to evidence
- **Note Modified**: Note updated
- **Tag Added**: Tag added to evidence
- **Tag Removed**: Tag removed from evidence
- **Marked Critical**: Evidence flagged as critical
- **Unmarked Critical**: Critical status removed

#### Data Flow

```swift
// Creating evidence
TextEntry(bodyText: "Initial content")
  → Automatically adds "Created" change history entry

// Editing text entry
textEntry.updateBodyText("Updated content", description: "Added more details")
  → Stores original: "Initial content"
  → Stores new: "Updated content"
  → Creates "Content Modified" history entry with timestamp

// Viewing history
EvidenceDetailView → ChangeHistoryView
  → Displays all changes in chronological order
  → Shows before/after comparison for modifications
```

#### Security & Privacy

- All change history is **encrypted** with the evidence
- History uses **cascade delete** (deleted with evidence)
- No ability to modify or delete history (audit integrity)
- Timestamps use device local time
- Changes stored in **SwiftData** with evidence models

#### File Organization

```

    └── Components/
        ├── ChangeHistoryView.swift  [NEW]
        └── EditTextEntrySheet.swift [NEW]
```

#### User Experience Flow

1. **Viewing Evidence Details**:
   - **Photos**: Tap to expand inline preview on timeline page (new!)
     - View full-size image without navigation
     - See notes and metadata
     - Option to view full details if needed
   - **Other evidence**: Tap to navigate to detail view
   - See full content preview with metadata
   - Scroll to view change history timeline
   - Location and tags displayed if available

2. **Editing Text Entries**:
   - Tap "Edit" button in detail view
   - Modify text in full-screen editor
   - See real-time comparison of changes
   - Add optional change description
   - Save → Original preserved in history

3. **Change History Timeline**:
   - Visual timeline with color-coded icons
   - Newest changes at top
   - Before/after comparison for modifications
   - Timestamps and optional descriptions
   - Icons indicate change type

#### Migration Notes

⚠️ **Breaking Change**: Existing evidence will not have change history.

- Old evidence shows only current state
- New evidence created after this update has full tracking
- Consider adding migration script to backfill creation history
- No data loss - only missing historical change records

#### Performance Considerations

- Images loaded **on-demand** in detail view (not in timeline)
- Change history **lazy loaded** via SwiftData relationships
- No performance impact on timeline scrolling
- Cascade delete prevents orphaned history records

#### Build Status

✅ **Build Successful** - October 7, 2025  
✅ **No Linter Errors**  
✅ **XcodeGen Integration** - Auto-includes new files  
✅ **Swift 6 Concurrency** - Fully compliant

#### Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:
- Edit notes/captions on photos and videos
- Text diff highlighting in change comparison
- Revert to previous version capability
- Export change history in PDF/Word documents
- Image comparison overlays (before/after edits)
